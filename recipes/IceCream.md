- 650 g Milk, whole
- 225 g Sugar, granulated
- 200 g Egg yolk (around 13 medium and small eggs)
- 150 g Heavy cream
- 45 g Nonfat dry milk powder
- 10 g Vanilla extract
- 5 g Salt
- Ice, for chilling, as needed
- Water, for chilling, as needed
- Dry ice, about 1 kg, as needed
- Flavor: traditionally you want to use Saffron, I used like half a gram (my scale is not sensitive enough to measure it)
- didn't have the milk powder, used 1 tsp Xantham gum instead

- First run, used half of "one chunk of dry ice" that I got from Haris Teeter.
- Should have used more dry ice, I over estimated how "cold" dry ice is, or actually how much energy it takes to sublimate a piece of dry ice.
- Too "eggy", should have used lower temperature.
- Too much Saffron, next time use half
- It tasts too sweet, don't know if I should reduce sugar, or it was because I didn't add the dry milk or any other emulsifier
- Consistency is good, a bit on the loose side
